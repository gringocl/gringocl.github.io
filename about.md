Hello, my name is Miles Starkenburg.  I love learning new things and challenging myself.  I am excited to leverage technolgy to make a difference and change peoples lives.

I have always been passionate about the Internet and recently completed an eight week intensive Ruby on Rails bootcamp at CodeFellows in Seattle, WA.
